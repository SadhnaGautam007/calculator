# calculator
Building a functional calculator application was a rewarding experience. This project involved more intricate use of JavaScript to handle the logic behind the calculations. Using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality, I created a fully operational calculator. This task helped me understand how to manipulate the DOM and manage events in JavaScript effectively. The calculator is a practical tool and a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create useful web applications.
